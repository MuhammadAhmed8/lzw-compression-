LZW is used to compress text files.

Trie is used as a dictionary for compression.Trie
contains a hashmap to store pointers to its children.

Decompression uses a dynamic array of strings since the code
size is fixed.

The LZW algorithm uses a 16-bit dictionary, and 
it is flushed after it is filled up with 2 << bits - 1  or 65535 entries.
