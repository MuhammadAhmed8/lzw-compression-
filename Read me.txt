LZW algorithm for compression text files.
It works on 256 asci characters.

Data-Structures Used:
- Trie
- A hashmap is used to store children of each Trie node

16 bit trie based dictionary is used, and is flushed after every 65,536 entries. 
Variable sized codes are written to the compressed file.

//Words.txt, bible.txt are test data files.
